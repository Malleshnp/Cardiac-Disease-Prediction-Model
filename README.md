The Cardiac Disease Prediction Model is a machine learning project designed to analyze patient health data and predict the likelihood of heart disease. By leveraging various medical attributes, this model aims to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and preventive care for cardiac patients.

Features

Predicts the probability of heart disease for a patient.

Supports multiple medical attributes, including:

Age

Sex

Blood Pressure

Cholesterol levels

Heart rate

Chest pain type

Fasting blood sugar

ECG results

Maximum heart rate achieved

Exercise-induced angina

ST depression

Slope of ST segment

Number of major vessels

Thalassemia

Provides evaluation metrics for model performance, such as:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Dataset

The model uses a structured dataset containing patient medical records. The dataset typically includes numeric, categorical, and binary features relevant to heart disease risk factors.
